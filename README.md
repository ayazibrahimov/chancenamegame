# Chance Number Game

This project is built using **Core JavaScript** and **Bend Bend CSS**.

## Project Description
The main logic of this project is to dynamically calculate a chance number for the user's input. As the user types something into the input field, the ASCII sequence number of each character is calculated and matched to generate a unique chance number.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core JavaScript is used to implement the dynamic functionality.
- **CSS**: Bend Bend CSS is used for styling the application, ensuring a clean and modern design.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to all mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features
- Real-time chance number generation based on user input.
- Interactive and dynamic UI with custom styling.
- Fully responsive design for a smooth experience on any device.

## How It Works
1. The user types their name (or any text) into the input field.
2. The application dynamically calculates the ASCII code of each character in the input.
3. The chance number is generated based on the calculated ASCII values and displayed instantly.
