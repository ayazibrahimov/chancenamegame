# Change Name Game

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Core JavaScript**. 

## Project Description
The main logic of this project is to dynamically calculate and display the ASCII sequence number of each letter as the user types something into the input field. The application finds the corresponding ASCII code for each character and processes it to generate the desired output.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core JavaScript is used to implement the dynamic functionality.
- **CSS**: CSS is used for styling the application, ensuring a clean and modern design.
- **HTML**: CSS is used for creating structure.
 
## Features
- Real-time ASCII code calculation for user input.
- Interactive and dynamic UI with custom styling.

## How It Works
1. The user types their name (or any text) into the input field.
2. The application dynamically calculates the ASCII code of each character in the input.
3. The corresponding sequence number or result is displayed instantly.

## How to Use
